JSON Easy: 100% Free & Open Source JSON Viewer for messy data.

Ever come across hard-to-read, minified, or malformed JSON while browsing? JSON Easy is a powerful JSON Viewer and JSON Formatter that helps you understand data instantly by showing it in a clean, readable format right on the page.

WHAT IT DOES:
* JSON Formatter & Beautifier: Shows JSON in a neat, organized way when you select text.
* Contextual Convenience: Works right where you are - no need to copy/paste to other websites or open new tabs.
* Smart Parsing: Unlike standard viewers, it handles both clean and "messy" JSON text including:
  - JSON objects & strings (stringified JSON)
  - Javascript objects & JSON5 (unquoted keys, trailing commas, comments)
  - Malformed fragments: Parses arrays or objects even without surrounding brackets.
  - Snippet Cleanup: Automatically strips line numbers from copied code snippets.
* One-click Export: Includes a copy button to save the formatted, beautified version.

HOW TO USE IT:
1. Select any JSON text on a webpage.
2. Click the orange icon, use the keyboard shortcut Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + E, or right-click and select "View formatted JSON".
3. See your data displayed in a perfectly readable format.
4. Copy the formatted version if needed for your editor.

HELPFUL FOR:
* Debugging API responses in the browser.
* Reading data exports and minified logs.
* Viewing JSON in GitHub PRs, Gists, and StackOverflow.
* Making sense of invalid JSON that other parsers reject.
* Learning how complex JSON data is structured.

Simple, useful, and works anywhere you browse. JSON Easy is the perfect utility for developers, data scientists, and anyone who needs to read JSON without the friction.

JSON Easy is 100% free and open source. We don't track you, we don't show ads, and we don't send your data anywhere. Check out the source code or contribute at https://github.com/khoadl-dev/jsoneasy
